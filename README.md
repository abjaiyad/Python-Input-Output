# Python – Basic Input/Output (I/O)  

This repository contains beginner-level Python exercises focused on **Basic Input/Output** operations using `input()` and `print()`. The goal is to understand how to take user input, process it, and display results effectively.  

## 📌 Topics Covered  
- Using `input()` to take user input  
- Understanding that `input()` returns a string  
- Converting input into other data types (`int()`, `float()`)  
- Displaying output with `print()`  
- String formatting using f-strings and `.format()`  

## 📝 Exercises Solved  

### Problem 1  
Take a user’s name as input and greet them.  
**Example:**  
Input: Amad   
Output: Hello Amad, welcome!  

### Problem 2  
Ask for two numbers and print their **sum**.  

### Problem 3  
Ask for **name, age, and favorite color**, then print in a formatted way:  
Hello <name>, you are <age> years old and your favorite color is <color>.  

### Problem 4  
Take three numbers as input and print their **average**.
